St Davids GP Surgery Closure

> Dear Neil, Joanna, Jeremy + Hywel Dda University Health Board,
>
> I request at the Health Board meeting 26th September, 2024 under “Matters Arising” the Board
reconsider their decision to disperse all patients from St Davids Surgery by 31 st October, 2024 which
was triggered by the resignation of Dr Riley’s contract with the General Medical Services (GMS)
Contract due to the lack of Doctors available to maintain the service.
This request follows a public meeting on 10 th September, 2024 at the St Davids City Hall attended by
nearly 200 residents.
The reasons for this request are as follows: -
> - The Board’s decision was based on mis-information, assumptions (e.g. alleged cost savings)
and insufficient evidence of consideration of suitable alternative premises and availability of
medical practitioners.
> - The lack of open and transparent engagement has resulted in a rushed response and no time
to safeguard services before the move.
> - St Davids City is unique; it is a remote location set on a rural peninsula. The Health Board
model for Primary Care Services, against which the decision was made, does not allow for
serving rural communities spread over a wide area.
> - Solva Surgery is a smaller practice and the Board’s plan is to increase its list size by 117%.
How can we be assured we receive the same care when we don’t know how many Doctors
will be provided and their terms of engagement?
> - The Health Board Report suggests adequate transport exists for patients without cars.
Patients are expected to travel by bus, which runs every 2 hours or by local TAXI or similar to
attend the surgery. Taxis return journey currently costs £20. Also note that the Solva
practice located down a hill in a small cul-de-sac of a residential estate with limited parking.
> - The report to the Board of 25 July stated that further discussion was necessary to see
whether works could be started or completed ahead of 1 November 2024. It also stated
“The building would, however, need to remain operational throughout the works”. NO work
as yet been carried out at Solva Surgery to provide the necessary alterations to
accommodate the additional 117% of patients by 31 st October, 2024. We do not believe the
premises will be ready in time.
> - What about the future of Solva? When and where would the talked about Peninsula Hub for
Primary Care materialise?
> I request the following options be supported at the next meeting of the Hywell Dda University
Health Board on 26 September 2024.
> 1. To support a combined practice of St Davids and Solva with services initially provided over two
sites, as currently modelled at Johnston and Neyland.
> 2. To delay the dispersal of patients and to retain services in the existing building in New Street
> to enable continued Primary Care Services and provide more time for the Community to
> evaluate purchase of the premises for community use.
